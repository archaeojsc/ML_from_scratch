# Machine Learning from "Scratch"

Building machine learning methods from basic principles is a great way to
understand the mathematical and algorithmic intuitions behind the methods. Yes
`scikit-learn` and such are quicker and easier (and generally faster), but it's
always good to have an understanding of what is going on "under the hood".

This repository will be my examples of a variety of machine learning methods
and algorithms from "scratch" (i.e., using minimal or base/common libraries).
Check back, as I'll be expanding the list as I have time and as I'm exploring
more on my own.

* $k$-means clustering ([Jupyter Notebook](notebooks/00_k_means.ipynb),
  [code](code/00_k_means.py))
* ISOMap dimensionality reduction (*coming soon*)
