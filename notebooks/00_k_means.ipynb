    "1. Initialize either with $k$ randomly selected points in the $n$-dimensional\n",
    "   feature space or $k$ randomly selected data points\n",
    "2. Assign all data points to the nearest of the $k$ selected points/centers\n",
    "3. Find the centroid of each $k$ assigned cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the assignments and/or centroids stop changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is simple -- find an assignment for all points such that, for each\n",
    "cluster, the within-cluster data points are closer to the group's centroid than\n",
    "they are to any other group's center.\n",
    "\n",
